**Active development of this project has moved to [github](https://github.com/pinky39/grove).**

Magicgrove is a computer implementation of a trading card game: Magic: The
Gathering. The goal of the project is to implement ai algorithms which can play
the game at the same level as a casual human player. Currently there are 690
unique cards implemented, mostly from Urza's block (593 out of 616 cards are
available). When compared to
[similar projects](http://www.slightlymagic.net/wiki/List_of_MTG_Engines) the
game excels at:

  * great user interface,
  * good 60-step lookahead ai with intelligent pruning algorithms,
  * sealed tournaments (up to 500 computer players),
  * draft tournaments,
  * save & load support,
  * easy & quick installation,
  * active development,
  * robustness.

## How AI is implemented ##

Magic: The Gathering is a game with hidden state. On every move, computer
simulates future moves and builds the game tree. Hidden information is not
available during simulation (computer is not cheating). Every leaf node is
scored and the best move is chosen according to min/max rule. Because the
unpruned game tree would take too long to evaluate, heuristics are used to
choose if the branch is expanded or not. Ai uses special rules for:

  * target selection,
  * timing of spells and abilities,
  * X cost calculation,
  * combat simulation,
  * mana payments,
  * repeated activations of abilities,
  * special card decisions

The game currently uses 60 steps look ahead, the search time rarely exceeds 5
seconds (on quad core machine).

### Deck generation ###
Limited decks are automatically generated from given starter and booster packs.
Computer first creates multiple decks for various color combinations, and then
chooses the one which wins a simulated tournament.

### Draft ###
Drafting AI is based on drafting strategies described here:

## Contributing to the project ##
The easiest way to get familiar with source is
to try to add some new cards. Check out the 'Adding cards tutorial' series:
